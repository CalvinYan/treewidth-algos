# A LINEAR-TIME ALGORITHM FOR FINDING TREE-DECOMPOSITIONS OF SMALL TREEWIDTH*
"""
Step 1:
apply O(n^2) algorithm that outputs either
-  treewidth of G > k
-  tree decomposition with  width <= 4k

Step 2: use graph minors

- G is minor of H if G can be obtained via vertex/edge deletion or edge contractions
- every graph has finite set of graphs that is closed under minors called obstruction set
- graph belongs to this set iff it has no graph from the obstruction set as a minor
- class of graphs with treewidth <= k is closed under minors for every fixed value of k

Check if the input graph is like that
- using dynamic programming in linear time

"""
Algorithm terms

for some d fixed later
- low-degree vertex:  degree <= d
- high-degree vertex:  degree > d
- friendly vertex: is low-degree, and adjacent to another low-degree vertex
- simplicial vertex: neighbors form a clique
- improved graph: obtained by adding edges between all vertices that have at least k+1 common neighbors of degree <= k
- I-simplicial: simplicial in the improved graph of G and has degree <= k in G
